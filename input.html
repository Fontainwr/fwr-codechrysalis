        Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing
        computation based on function abstraction and application using variable
        binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can
        be used to simulate any Turing machine. It was introduced by the
        mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the
        foundations of mathematics.
