// 9. Not reading the error messages
// Error messages are your friend! Familiarize yourself with common error messages and what they mean — do not ignore them.

// Error messages will also give you a line number in your code where the error originated from. Pay attention to them and do not be afraid to Google what your error message is telling you.

// Common error messages for beginner coders:

// Uncaught ReferenceError: ______ is not defined
// This usually happens because a variable or function name is missing; the JavaScript engine is not sure what you are referring to. Are you sure you spelled everything correctly? Are all of your variables declared? Did you copy/paste code? (Please don’t copy-paste code without understanding it.)

// Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
// Did you forget a closing or opening bracket or parentheses? That is usually the case.

// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
// This often happens when you are trying to read a property or call a method on an undefined object. Are you using a method that does not exist on an object? Is your object defined?

//Do not be afraid to use console.log to print out a variable as you are coding. You are allowed to run your code as many times as you need. Make sure that you test your assumptions — are you sure that variable is a function? A string? A number?

// Sometimes, what you think is a 2 is instead a '2'and that can make a big difference in code. Use console.log and also typeof to double-check that what you think is true.

// This will also protect you from bugs. It can be frustrating to write a bunch of code, only to run it at the end and realize that there is something wrong. Protect yourself from making these mistakes before you reach the end.
